# BA-Thesis_NorthEuraLex

This repository contains the code used in my Bachelor's Thesis. The thesis can be found as a pdf file on the top level, while the Jupyter Notebooks with the code are in the _notebooks_ folder.

Used data sets / weights are saved in _data_, and all outputs generated within the Thesis' code are in the _output_ folder.
